## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure Server

### Option 1: Using Environment Variable (Recommended)

1. **Create/Edit `.env` file** in the `server` folder:
   ```env
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password-here
   ```

2. **Update server.js** (if needed):
   The code already uses environment variable:
   ```javascript
   pass: process.env.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD || 'your_app_password_here'
   ```

3. **Install dotenv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install dotenv
   ```

4. **Add to top of server.js** (if not already there):
   ```javascript
   import dotenv from 'dotenv';
   dotenv.config();
   ```

### Option 2: Direct Configuration (For Testing Only)

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOT RECOMMENDED for production**

Replace in `server/server.js` line 43:
```javascript
pass: 'your-16-character-app-password-here'
```
